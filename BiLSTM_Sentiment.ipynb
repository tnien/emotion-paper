and staff behaviour was very friendlyngreat ambiencenthanks for boho teamnmust try nachus and boho chilli chicken and bbq pork risbs rated 10 ratedn okay so i thought i should be polite in my reviewnbut the way they treat the guests is horriblen1 they are least bothered to come and take orders2 they miss out on the orders and when we ask they say that weve never orderedn3 asking for a glass of water is a sin they think they are doing a huge favour by providing the samenoverall a pathetic service and would never recommend rated 30 ratedn kamikaze shots were good and nicely madenamazing and beautiful ambience crowd is also good this place is situated in heart of koramanglaa so easy to findnparties on friday and saturday are lit nif youre a club freak then this is the place for you rated 10 ratedn we went to koramangala for some work on a sunday evening and decided to go to boho in evening seeing 41 stars on zomato it was a fine looking place when we stepped in but they had placed reserved placard on almost every table and wouldnt take that table we asked them how is it that all tables are reserved and told them we would sit for 3045 minutes they still didnt let us take any table out of atleast 1015 vacant table and gave us a table with filthy chairs saying only that was available by the time we left almost all of those reserved tables were still vacantnnafter this issue we were hoping for good food atleast but that was a disappointment again we ordered one mac and cheese i havent had that bad pasta ever it was not even boiled properly and i had chew a lot to eat it we ordered prawns and that was bad as well we literally went out and had something else to fill in our tummies not recommended at all rated 30 ratedn we went for a short time today to have evening snack around 730 food is ok staff is worst with very bad service first they had lot of discussion about seating we went for sometime n wanted to sit in the balcony but the staff was insisting us to sit somewhere else giving lame excuse that balcony space is for big group there was lot of space available my experience was very bad altogether have given 3 star for ambience n music rated 30 ratedn the place has a good ambience and interiors the menu is a little limited though at first instance u will feel that the place is little inexpensive but the portions are very small and u end up spending more overall an okay place to hangout with friends and have few drinks rated 10 ratedn we were a couple and a stag who went into the place didnt allow entry despite calling 5 minutes before to confirm paid stag entry for our friend the bouncer at the entry was extremely rude and arrogant he said his name was ajith extremely arrogant about it too dont want to go to a place which treats customers with such high level of disrespect no way to talk to manager also will never go again rated 40 ratedn had a great time on last friday night music was very good nice ambiance but

in one small piece they have given fried rice as complimentary rated 40 ratedn ive honestly lost count of how many times ive visited the place just to dance with friends and not have a morsel to eat or a drop of drinknnon the rare occasions when we feel the need to satisfy hunger pangs we order the following in a minutennmust havenn1 this place has good starters veg platter snap bites where no restaurant can go wrong andn2 pasta penne arabiata is a safe constant for us whenever we visit the placennapart from food the high rating is because of the music they play here and the constant energy which is so contagious that even an amateur dancer is on hisher toes in seconds loved the vibe of the place because of the sheer millennial population in this pub no other pub ive seen such energetic crowd and such good mix of songs rated 40 ratedn been here on a saturday night the music was very good and accompanied by a cheerful crowd the ambience is very good its not a very big place and towards the end of the night the dance floor was so packed we couldnt even move the food is average we had ordered barbecue chicken wings chicken nachos and cheesy fries the wings were very dry and the nachos were bland not very great this place is a bit on the pricey side the food and staff is not up to the mark it is a finger food and bar kind of place if you want a fun and energetic with some good music and a party crowd this is the place to be rated 40 ratedn nice ambiance with good food also a great place to chill out with friends tried various cocktails and red wine along with sausage platter pizza and chicken steak food was too good but i feel service needs to be improved a bit rated 20 ratedn to be honest the music is way too loud to have a conversation not just with friends but

which runs every wednesday and friday nn1 chicken tikka lababdar pizza decent not very good but not bad too n2 la pinoz paneer pizza again decent not very good but not badnncommon observation while the joint boasts of giant slices its 10 pies were kinda underwhelming mind you that the crust is medium neither thick not thin id still felt fulfilled in case of other joints but not here also i felt a consistent lack of salt in both pizza the vegetarian one felt bland and even addition of seasoning didnt helpnnoverall i didnt feel bad for spending 509 bucks for 2 pies however if i wouldve gone on nonoffer day i definitely wouldve felt cheated rated 40 ratedn i have ordered 2 times from them we can get good food in a pretty reasonable budget for sure from la pinoz the pizza here is soft and
